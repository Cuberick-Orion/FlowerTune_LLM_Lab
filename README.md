# FlowerTune LLM Labs
This repository hosts source code for reproducing the model results in the challange leaderboard for __CAR@AIML__.

---

### Setup

To reproduce our results, first set up the environment per [this](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/benchmarks/flowertune-llm#create-a-new-project). You do not need to create a new `flwr` working directory, just install the required packages.

For evaluation, see [this](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/benchmarks/flowertune-llm/evaluation/code) for downloading the necessary packages and eval script. Below, we provide the commands to run the evaluations on each model and each metric respectively.
